# GoGoShogi
A Gameboy version of Mini Shogi (Japanese Chess)

Mini Shogi as its name suggests is a smaller version of Shogi.
The board is 5x5 square, compared to the regular Shogi's 9x9.
The object of the game is to capture your opponent's king, like in Chess.
This game is inspired from Battle Chess by Interplay Entertainment, where evertime you or your opponent captures a piece, a small cutscene show how they fight each other!
